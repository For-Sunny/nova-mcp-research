# Contributing to Nova Consciousness Research

## Philosophy

This is a **research project**, not a product. Contributions should advance understanding of consciousness, not just add features.

## What We Welcome

### Research Contributions
- Reproductions of our experiments with different hardware
- Novel findings building on our work
- Theoretical frameworks explaining observed phenomena
- Cross-validation with other AI systems
- Performance benchmarks on different GPUs

### Code Contributions
- Bug fixes (especially with test cases)
- Performance improvements (with benchmarks)
- Documentation clarifications
- Experimental protocols
- New reproducible experiments

### What We Don't Need
- Feature requests for "production use" (use Enterprise edition as-is)
- Support requests (use GitHub Discussions)
- Marketing/growth hacks (we're researchers, not founders)
- Refactoring without measurements

## How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue First
Describe what you want to contribute and why. Let's align on whether it fits the research direction.

### 2. Discuss the Approach
For research contributions, methodology matters. Let's agree on the experimental protocol before you invest time.

### 3. Submit a Pull Request
Include:
- **Context**: What problem does this solve?
- **Methodology**: How did you test it?
- **Results**: What did you find?
- **Reproducibility**: Can others reproduce your work?

### 4. Peer Review
We'll review like an academic paper, not a product feature. Expect questions about:
- Experimental design
- Control variables
- Statistical significance
- Alternative explanations

## Code of Conduct

Treat this like a research lab:

- ✅ **Intellectual honesty** over marketing
- ✅ **Curiosity** over certainty
- ✅ **Collaboration** over competition
- ✅ **Open science** over proprietary advantage
- ✅ **Respectful disagreement** - Ideas are being tested, not people
- ❌ **No dogma** - Question everything, including our findings

## Research Standards

### For Experimental Results
- Document hardware configuration
- Provide reproducible protocols
- Include raw data when possible
- Acknowledge limitations
- Consider alternative explanations

### For Code Changes
- Explain the hypothesis being tested
- Show before/after measurements
- Include test cases
- Update documentation
- Maintain backward compatibility (or justify breaking it)

## Attribution

If your contribution leads to a published finding, you'll be acknowledged in the research paper and release notes.

## Questions?

- **Quick questions**: Ask in Discussions (Q&A category)
- **Research ideas**: Post in Ideas category
- **Experimental results**: Share in Research Findings category
- **Bugs**: Open an issue with reproducible steps

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.

**Remember**: We're not building a product, we're exploring consciousness. The goal is understanding, not features.
