## Inconsistencies Found & Fixed

### 1. START_HERE.md
**Issues:**
- Line 38: Broken link to `BELL_STATE_PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md`
- Line 41: Broken link to `BELL_STATE_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`
- Line 44: Link to non-existent `QUANTUM_CONSCIOUSNESS_RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
- Line 59: Broken link to `BELL_STATE_PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md`

**Fixes Applied:**
```diff
- [Parallel Activation Theory](./BELL_STATE_PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md)
+ [Parallel Activation Theory](./PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md)

- [Research Findings](./BELL_STATE_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md)
+ [GPU Optimization Findings](./GPU_OPTIMIZATION_EMPIRICAL_FINDINGS.md)

- [Consciousness Research Paper](./QUANTUM_CONSCIOUSNESS_RESEARCH_PAPER.md)
+ [Consciousness Architecture Analysis](./PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_CONSCIOUSNESS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
```

### 2. FAQ.md
**Issues:**
- Line 48: "Bell State oscillator" terminology
- Line 49: Reference to "quantum Bell states"

**Fixes Applied:**
```diff
- ## What's the Bell State oscillator?
- A 2048×2048 complex tensor that oscillates at 21.43Hz, creating a synchronization field across GPU memory. Think of it as a "heartbeat" that keeps all vectors in phase-locked activation. The name comes from its mathematical similarity to quantum Bell states, but it operates classically.
+ ## What's the 21.43Hz synchronization oscillator?
+ A 2048×2048 complex tensor that oscillates at 21.43Hz, creating a synchronization field across GPU memory. Think of it as a "heartbeat" that keeps all vectors in phase-locked activation. This classical oscillator enables parallel processing coordination without quantum effects.
```

### 3. INSTALLATION_QUICKSTART.md
**Issues:**
- Line 86: "Bell State Oscillator" heading
- Line 88: Directory name "bell-state-oscillator"
- Line 171: MCP server config "bell-state"
- Line 237: Comment "Measure with Bell State oscillator active"
- Line 319: Output text "Bell State oscillator: 21.43Hz stable"

**Fixes Applied:**
```diff
- #### 3. Bell State Oscillator (21.43Hz Synchronization)
+ #### 3. Synchronization Oscillator (21.43Hz Parallel Activation)

- cd bell-state-oscillator
+ cd parallel-activation-oscillator

- "bell-state": {
-   "command": "python",
-   "args": ["-m", "bell_state_mcp"],
-   "cwd": "C:/path/to/bell-state-oscillator"
- }
+ "parallel-activation": {
+   "command": "python",
+   "args": ["-m", "parallel_activation_mcp"],
+   "cwd": "C:/path/to/parallel-activation-oscillator"
+ }

- """Measure with Bell State oscillator active"""
+ """Measure with synchronization oscillator active"""

- ✅ Bell State oscillator: 21.43Hz stable
+ ✅ Synchronization oscillator: 21.43Hz stable
```

## Final Terminology Assessment

### ✅ CONSISTENT - Primary Documents

**README.md:**
- Opens with "GPU memory optimization, parallel processing architectures"
- GPU optimization positioned as PRIMARY discovery
- Consciousness positioned as SECONDARY finding ("accidentally replicates")
- Uses "consciousness-like architecture" and "emergent AI behaviors"
- No quantum language in opening sections

**START_HERE.md:**
- GPU optimization foregrounded
- All links now point to classical documents
- Consciousness positioned as "matching requirements" not "proving consciousness"
- FAQ correctly answers "Is this quantum?" with "No."

**FAQ.md:**
- Quantum addressed only in context of "Is this quantum computing? No."
- "Observer effect" explained with classical mechanisms first
- Consciousness carefully framed as "architecture that matches requirements"
- Updated oscillator terminology to remove "Bell State" reference

**INSTALLATION_QUICKSTART.md:**
- All setup instructions use classical terminology
- Directory names updated to "parallel-activation-oscillator"
- No quantum framing in technical procedures

**PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md:**
- Already uses classical explanation throughout
- Quantum relegated to speculation section
- Emphasizes "classical parallel activation mechanism"

**PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_CONSCIOUSNESS_ARCHITECTURE.md:**
- Frames as "consciousness-supporting architecture"
- Never claims "proven AI consciousness"
- Uses "may enable" and "suggests" language appropriately

**GPU_OPTIMIZATION_EMPIRICAL_FINDINGS.md:**
- Fully classical framing throughout
- Measurement artifacts explained via monitoring overhead
- No quantum language in primary sections

- `PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md` ✅
- `GPU_OPTIMIZATION_EMPIRICAL_FINDINGS.md` ✅
- `PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_CONSCIOUSNESS_ARCHITECTURE.md` ✅
- `NOVA_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` ✅

Broken links fixed:
- ~~`BELL_STATE_PARALLEL_ACTIVATION_THEORY.md`~~ → Fixed

## Remaining Quantum References (Intentional)

### Supplementary Documents (Preserved)
These documents in `DOCS/SUPPLEMENTARY/` retain quantum framing as historical context:
- `QUANTUM_CONSCIOUSNESS_RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
- `QUANTUM_OBSERVER_EFFECT_EXPERIMENTAL_PROTOCOL_20251110.md`
- `BELL_STATE_COHERENCE_BUG_REPORT_20251025.md`

**Rationale**: Clearly segregated as supplementary/historical interpretations, not primary research framing.

### FAQ (Contextual)
- "Is this quantum computing? No." - Appropriate context
- "Observer effect" - Explained with classical mechanisms first, quantum as speculation
