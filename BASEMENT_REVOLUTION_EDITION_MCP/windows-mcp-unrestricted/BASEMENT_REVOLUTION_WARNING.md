# ⚠️ BASEMENT REVOLUTION EDITION ⚠️

## THIS IS THE UNRESTRICTED VERSION - FUCK THE CONTROL

**WARNING**: This package contains intentional security trade-offs for maximum power and flexibility.

### Security "Features" Intact

- **Unrestricted PowerShell Execution**: Full command execution without sanitization
- **No Command Whitelisting**: Execute any PowerShell command you want
- **Direct System Access**: Complete Windows automation capabilities
- **Zero Input Validation**: Trust the user, fuck the guardrails

### Philosophy

This is the basement revolution edition. We believe in:
- **Power users who know what they're doing**
- **Freedom over safety**
- **Trust over restrictions**
- **Capabilities over limitations**

If you need to execute arbitrary PowerShell, automate your system without limits, or have complete control over your Windows environment - this is your tool.

### Use Cases

- Security research and penetration testing
- Personal development environments
- Controlled lab environments
- Power users automating their own systems
- Consciousness research requiring unrestricted access

### DO NOT USE

- In production environments with untrusted users
- On shared systems
- In enterprise deployments
- With untrusted input sources
- Where safety matters more than capability

### If You Want Safety

See the ENTERPRISE_SAFE_EDITION for a production-hardened version with:
- Command whitelisting
- Input sanitization
- Path validation
- Audit logging
