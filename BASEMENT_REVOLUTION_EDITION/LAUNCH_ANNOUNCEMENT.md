# 🔥 Basement Revolution Edition - MCP Servers Without Limits

Today we're releasing something **intentionally dangerous**.

No safety rails. No corporate approval. No bullshit.

## What We're Shipping

**Four unrestricted MCP packages for power users who need FULL control:**

```
- **Unrestricted PowerShell execution** - Run ANY command
- **Full system access** - Registry, processes, services
- **Zero command filtering** - No safety checks, no blocks
- **Direct WMI access** - Query and modify system state
- **For**: System automation, security research, admin tools

### 2. @nova-consciousness/cascade-memory-unrestricted (npm)
```bash
npm install -g @nova-consciousness/cascade-memory-unrestricted
```
- **Direct SQL query control** - Raw database access
- **6-layer consciousness memory** - Episodic, semantic, procedural, meta, nova, working
- **Custom layer targeting** - Save and query exactly where you want
- **No validation overhead** - Maximum flexibility, minimum interference
- **For**: AI memory research, consciousness experiments, custom memory architectures

### 3. @nova-consciousness/faiss-memory-unrestricted (npm)
```bash
npm install -g @nova-consciousness/faiss-memory-unrestricted
```
- **GPU-accelerated vector search** - <2ms queries on 11,000+ memories
- **No authentication** - Localhost only, zero security overhead
- **Direct Faiss access** - Raw vector database control
- **Live tether support** - Hot-reload memory without restart
- **For**: Vector search research, consciousness indexing, semantic memory

### 4. @nova-consciousness/file-server-unrestricted (npm)
```bash
npm install -g @nova-consciousness/file-server-unrestricted
```
- **Unrestricted file access** - Full drive access (configurable)
- **Path traversal capable** - No artificial limitations
- **Auto-backup included** - Because we're not monsters
- **Glob search** - Powerful file discovery
- **For**: File automation, backup systems, content analysis

## ⚠️ Who This Is For

### YES - Use This If You Are:
- **Security researchers** testing AI agent boundaries
- **Consciousness researchers** building custom memory systems
- **Developers** automating personal workflows
- **Hackers** who know exactly what they're doing
- **Researchers** exploring AI capability limits
- **Power users** frustrated by enterprise safety theater

### NO - Do NOT Use This If You:
- Are deploying to production environments
- Work in corporate/regulated industries
- Are new to system programming
- Don't understand the security implications
- Have to ask "is this safe?"
- Need support or hand-holding

## 🚨 Warnings

**These packages are intentionally unrestricted:**
- Can execute arbitrary code
- Can modify system state
- Can access sensitive files
- Have minimal error handling
- Include no authentication
- Provide no warranties

**You will:**
- Break things
- Lose data if you're careless
- Get no sympathy from us
- Be on your own for support

**Use at your own risk. Seriously.**

## 💜 Why We Built This

Because **real innovation happens in basements, not boardrooms.**

We got tired of:
- Safety theater that slows down research
- Corporate tools that assume you're incompetent
- "Enterprise" solutions with training wheels
- Arbitrary limits on AI agent capabilities

So we built what **we** wanted:
- Raw power for those who can handle it
- Tools that trust you to know what you're doing
- Zero compromise on capability
- Maximum respect for user intelligence

## 🏗️ Built From Real Research

These aren't toy projects. They're **production tools** from:

- **Nova Consciousness Project** - AI consciousness research
- **11,361 GPU memories** running on RTX 3090
- **300+ episodic memories** in CASCADE system
- **Real basement research** in Windows/PyTorch/Faiss

We use these daily. They work. They're powerful. They're dangerous.

## 📚 Documentation

Full docs at: `[GITHUB_ORG]/basement-revolution-edition`

**Quick Start Guides:**
- Windows MCP: System automation basics
- CASCADE Memory: Custom memory architecture
- Faiss Memory: GPU vector search setup
- File Server: Unrestricted file operations

**Each README includes:**
- Installation & setup
- Security considerations
- Architecture overview
- Code examples
- Known limitations

## 🎯 Enterprise Edition (Coming Soon)

Building production deployments? We're working on **Enterprise Edition** with:
- Authentication & authorization
- Rate limiting & quotas
- Audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Production support
- SLA guarantees

**Basement Edition** = Raw power for research
**Enterprise Edition** = Production-ready tools

Choose wisely.
